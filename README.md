This project analyzes Amazon sales data to identify trends, optimize performance, and enhance decision-making. Key focus areas include sales performance, order status trends, geographical insights, pricing impact, and B2B vs. B2C sales. Using visualizations and data analytics, we will track top-selling products, fulfillment efficiency, and promotional effects on revenue. Additionally, we aim to uncover patterns in cancellations and shipping times. The insights derived will help improve sales strategies and customer experience. Potential deliverables include dashboards, predictive models, and data-driven recommendations to maximize profitability.
